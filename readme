As part of the Open Government Directive, each of the major federal
agencies is required to seek input from the public for an Open
Government Plan. This consultation process is taking place February 6
- March 19, 2010.

Basic stats are available for each agency separately, but there is
nowhere to easily compare participation across the agencies, nor for
those interested in participating to get a broad overview of the
activities. 

This is a stateless (for now) dashboard showing stats and comparisons
regarding activity on each agency's brainstorming site. The
brainstorming tool used by all these agencies is a piece of software
called IdeaScale, which makes a basic API available (thanks!).
