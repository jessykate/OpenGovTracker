As part of the Open Government Directive, each of the major federal
agencies is required to seek input from the public for an Open
Government Plan. This consultation process is taking place February 6
- March 19, 2010, using a platform called IdeaScale. Each agency has
it's own, isolated IdeaScale site.

Basic stats are available for each agency separately, but there is
nowhere to easily compare participation across the agencies, nor for
those interested in participating to get a broad overview of the
activities. 

This is a stateless (for now) dashboard showing stats and comparisons
regarding activity on each agency's brainstorming site, using the
basic API made available by IdeaScale (thanks!).
